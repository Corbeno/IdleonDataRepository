This directory is for scripts that can be used to parse the Z.js file that Idleon uses. Ideally, every mapping would have a coorsponding script that could be run whenever the game updates which would eliminate the need for manually parsing the massive Z.js file.

There isn't any restrictions currently for these scripts. It doesn't matter what language they are written in either. Just give instructions on how to run the script and what it parses as a comment at the top, and that should be good enough!
