This section of the repository maps useful datapoints together. A lot of items in the Idleon save data need to be statically linked to their display names as they are stored as something completely different in the backend.

# Contributing
If you would like to submit a pull request adding/updating one of these maps, please adhere to the following.

1. The data submitted must reflect what is displayed in Idleon. Things generally shouldn't be made up.
2. Please don't submit pull requests for data that isn't in the game yet. If you are an alpha tester, it would be considered leaking alpha information, which is bad!
3. It is important to add a "__comment" object at the top of the JSON body that breifly describes what the mapping does. This is curucial to other developers that need to understand this information.
